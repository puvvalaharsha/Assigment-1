			<h1>POEM:The Raven</h1>
			<p>
				Deep into that darkness peering,
				Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
				Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals
				Ever dared to dream before;
				But the silence was unbroken,
				And the stillness gave no token,
				And the only word there spoken
				Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br><br>
				Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
				I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
				But when I start to tell them,
				They think I'm telling lies.
				I say,<br><br>
						It's in the reach of my arms
						The span of my hips,
						The stride of my step,
						The curl of my lips.
							<br><br>I'm a woman
							Phenomenally.
							Phenomenal woman,
								That's me.
						I walk into a room
						Just as cool as you please,
							And to a man,<br>
						The fellows stand or
					Fall down on their knees.
					Then they swarm around me,
					A hive of honey bees.<br><br>
					I say,
					It's the fire in my eyes,
					 the flash of my teeth,
					The swing in my waist,
					And the joy in my feet.<br><br>
							I'm a woman
							Phenomenally.
							Phenomenal woman,
								That's me.
