		<h1 id="abc">Operating System Generations</h1>
		<p id="p1">Until the 1960â€™s, there were two types of computer systems i.e the scientific and the commercial computers. These were combined by IBM in the System/360. This used integrated circuits and provided a major price and performance advantage over the second generation systems</p>
		<p id="p2">The third generation operating systems also introduced multiprogramming. This meant that the processor was not idle while a job was completing its I/O operation. Another job was scheduled on the processor so that its time would not be wasted.
		</p>

		<p id="p3">Digital computers were not constructed until the second world war. Calculating engines with mechanical relays were built at that time. However, the mechanical relays were very slow and were later replaced with vacuum tubes. These machines were enormous but were still very slow.</p>
