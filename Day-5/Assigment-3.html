		<p>Until the 1960’s, there were two types of computer systems i.e the scientific and the commercial computers. These were combined by IBM in the System/360. This used integrated circuits and provided a major price and performance advantage over the second generation systems</p>

			<p>Digital computers were not constructed until the second world war. Calculating engines with mechanical relays were built at that time. However, the mechanical relays were very slow and were later replaced with vacuum tubes. These machines were enormous but were still very slow.</p>

			<p>These early computers were designed, built and maintained by a single group of people. Programming languages were unknown and there were no operating systems so all the programming was done in machine language. All the problems were simple numerical calculations.</p>
			<section>
				<p>Transistors led to the development of the computer systems that could be manufactured and sold to paying customers. These machines were known as mainframes and were locked in air-conditioned computer rooms with staff to operate them.</p>
			</section>
			<p>The Batch System was introduced to reduce the wasted time in the computer. A tray full of jobs was collected in the input room and read into the magnetic tape. After that, the tape was rewound and mounted on a tape drive.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Then the batch operating system was loaded in which read the first job from the tape and ran it. The output was written on the second tape. After the whole batch was done, the input and output tapes were removed and the output tape was printed.</p>
