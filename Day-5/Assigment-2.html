			<p>The log files record all the events that occur in an operating system. This is done by writing all the messages into a log file. There are different types of log files. Some of these are given as follows −</p>

			<p>These stores the records of all the events that occur in the execution of a system. This is done so that the activities of all the events can be understood to diagnose problems</p>
		</div>
		<p>The core dump files contain the memory address space of a process that terminates unexpectedly. The creation of the core dump is triggered in response to program crashes by the kernel. The core dump files are used by the developers to find the program’s state at the time of its termination so that they can find out why the termination occurred.</p>

		<p>This is a type of program analysis that measures various parameters in a program such as space and time complexity, frequency and duration of function calls, usage of specific instructions etc. Profiling is done by monitoring the source code of the required system program using a code profiler.</p>
		<div>
			<p>The trace listing record information about a program execution using logging. This information is used by programmers for debugging. </p>
			<p>This memory dump contains the list of device drivers, stop code, process and thread information, kernel stack etc.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The transaction logs store the changes to the data so that the system can recover from crashes and other errors.</p>
