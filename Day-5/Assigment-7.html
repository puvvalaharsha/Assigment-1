			The Fourth Generation ( 1980 - Present ): Personal Computers

			<p>Personal Computers were easy to create with the development of large-scale integrated circuits. These were chips containing thousands of transistors on a square centimeter of silicon. Because of these, microcomputers were much cheaper than minicomputers and that made it possible for a single individual to own one of them.

			The advent of personal computers also led to the growth of networks. This created network operating systems and distributed operating systems. The users were aware of a network while using a network operating system and could log in to remote machines and copy files from one machine to another.</p>
