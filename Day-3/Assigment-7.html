			<h1>1-Tier Architecture</h1>
			In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it.
   			Any changes done here will directly be done on the database itself. It doesn't provide a handy tool for end users.
			The 1-Tier architecture is used for development of the local application, where programmers can directly communicate with the database for the quick response.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>2-Tier Architecture</h2>
			The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction, API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used.
			The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side.
			The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management.
			To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.
